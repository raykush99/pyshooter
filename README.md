A shooter game with different abilities. Made using pygame in python and was my first python game it made. The game has multiple powerups and gets harder the longer you play. 
Powerups:
    Speed Boost - q
    Rapid Fire - 1
    Shield - 2
Each powerup lasts 5 seconds
You can collect hearts to gain back health
Move using the "wasd" keys and use you mouse to aim and shoot (left click to shoot)

* In replit, the first time you have to run the program, then go to the developer page and click run VNC output. This should open a VNC tab where you can see and run the game. The first run may be buggy, so once you open the VNC the first time, just re-run the program to play the game. Directions are above.
